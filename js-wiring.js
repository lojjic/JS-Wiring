/**
 * <h1>JS Wiring: Dependency Injection for JavaScript</h1>
 *
 * <p>This is a lightweight dependency injection container for JavaScript objects.
 * It provides a simple mechanism for configuring object instances and how they
 * are wired together, so that those objects themselves do not have to contain
 * logic for creating/obtaining their dependencies.</p>
 *
 * <p>For an overview of dependency injection concepts, see
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection</p>
 *
 * <p>This container is modeled loosely after Spring Framework's IoC container;
 * the biggest difference is that the configuration is done with a simple JavaScript
 * object structure rather than XML.  Like Spring it supports constructor-argument
 * injection and setter-method injection, but also supports direct property injection
 * which is more natural in the JavaScript world.  Like Spring, object definitions can
 * inherit from one another.  Unlike Spring, objects are not instantiated until they
 * are requested directly or are required to satisfy another managed object's dependencies,
 * which improves performance.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
 *
 * <p>Objects are configured by calling <code>Wiring.add( defs )</code>, where
 * <code>defs</code> is an object containing one or more object definitions, each
 * identified by an arbitrary unique key. This key is used by other object definitions
 * when referencing dependencies.  Each definition specifies which JavaScript class
 * will be instantiated, and any constructor arguments and/or properties which will be
 * automatically injected.  A simple example:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>Wiring.add( {
 *     myObject: {
 *         type: MyJSClass,
 *         properties: {
 *             someProp: 'some value'
 *         }
 *    }
 * } );</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>With the above example, when some piece of code calls <code>Wiring.get( 'myObject' )</code>,
 * the container will find this definition, create an instance of the <code>MyJSClass</code>
 * class, and sets that instance's <code>someProp</code> property to the string value 'some value'.</p>
 *
 * <p>The real good stuff happens when you configure two or more objects and wire them together:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>Wiring.add( {
 *     objectOne: {
 *         type: MyJSClass,
 *         properties: {
 *             someProp: 'some value'
 *         }
 *     },
 *     objectTwo: {
 *         type: MyJSClass2,
 *         properties: {
 *             myDependency: '{ref:objectOne}'
 *         }
 *     }
 * } );</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>Now when some piece of code calls <code>Wiring.get( 'myObjectTwo' )</code>, the container will
 * create a MyJSClass2 instance, then create a MyJSClass instance and inject its property, and then
 * inject the MyJSClass instance into the MyJSClass2 instance as its 'myDependency' property.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is the real utility of Dependency Injection: objectTwo only has to know that it has a
 * 'myDependency' property which is an instance or subclass of MyJSClass; it does not have to know
 * anything at all about how that dependency gets created, what exact concrete class was used to
 * construct it, or how it was configured.  It simply expects that the dependency will be provided
 * to it (aka "injected") by some external mechanism.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Definition Inheritance</h2>
 *
 * <p>TODO</p>
 *
 * <h2>Object Definition Structure</h2>
 *
 * <p>Below are all the possible properties of the definition object. When the value type "VALUE" is
 * referenced, this means that a property can have a value of:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A literal value: String, Number, or Boolean</li>
 *     <li>A value "placeholder". This is a String that begins and ends with curly braces and contains a prefix that
 *         matches that of a registered ValueResolver instance.  The placeholder string will be replaced by an
 *         expanded value returned by the <code>ValueResolver</code>.  By default the container understands
 *         the "{ref:objectDefId}" placeholder, which gets replaced by an instantiated and fully-configured
 *         object from another definition in the wiring container, and the "{factory:objectDefId}" placehodler,
 *         which creates a Wiring.Factory object for creating objects from another definition in the wiring container.
 *         This is how managed objects are wired into other managed objects as dependencies.</li>
 *     <li>An Array or Object; when evaluated by the container these will be deep-copied into a new
 *         Array/Object.  During the copy each member will be treated as a VALUE of its own,
 *         allowing recursive value expansion.  In other words, value placeholders such as
 *         "{ref:objectDefId}" can occur at any depth in the object/array structure.
 * </ul>

 *
 * <h2>Merging</h2>
 *
 * <p>Sometimes when you have a child definition inheriting from a parent definition, you want that
 * child definition's properties or constructor arguments to be merged with the corresponding
 * properties or constructor arguments in the parent definition, rather than overriding them.
 * This is particularly useful for array items, where you want to have a base set of members
 * defined in the parent, and let the child definition add to that list.</p>
 *
 * <p>To support this, you can use the <code>merge</code> function to mark an object or array
 * property or constructor argument so that it will be merged with its parent.  If used on an
 * Object, its properties will be merged with the corresponding Object in its parent.  If used
 * on an Array, the items of the child Array will be appended to the items of the corresponding
 * Array in its parent.  For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>Wiring.add( {
 *     parentObject: {
 *         properties: {
 *             objectProp: { parentProp: 'foo' },
 *             arrayProp: [ 'parentMember' ]
 *         }
 *     },
 *     childObject: {
 *         properties: {
 *             objectProp: Wiring.merge( { childProp: 'bar' } ),
 *             arrayProp: Wiring.merge( [ 'childMember' ] )
 *         }
 *     }
 * } );</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>With the definitions above, when <code>childObject</code> is created it will result in
 * the following structure:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>{
 *     "objectProp": { "parentProp": "foo", "childProp": "bar" },
 *     "arrayProp": [ "parentMember", "childMember" ]
 * }</code></pre>
 *
 * <h2>Factories</h2>
 *
 * <p>While the dependency injection pattern is great for configuring single dependencies
 * which are created once up-front, it does not handle the common case where an object needs to
 * be able to create multiple instances of another class on-the-fly dependent on runtime data.
 * We need a mechanism by which dependencies can be instantiated on demand and still themselves
 * be configured by the wiring container.</p>
 *
 * <p>To handle this, you can use <code>Wiring.Factory</code>. This is a very simple class with
 * a single <code>refId</code> property, which you will configure to point to the object definition
 * that will be instantiated, and a single <code>createInstance</code> method which the controlling
 * code will invoke to create an instance. An example:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>Wiring.add( {
 *     objectOne: {
 *         type: MyJSClass,
 *         singleton: false,
 *         properties: {
 *             prop1: 'some value 1'
 *             prop2: 'some value 2'
 *         }
 *     },
 *     objectTwo: {
 *         type: MyJSClass2,
 *         properties: {
 *             myFactory: '{ref:objectOneFactory}'
 *         }
 *     },
 *     objectOneFactory: {
 *         type: Wiring.Factory,
 *         properties: {
 *             refId: 'objectOne'
 *         }
 *     }
 * } );</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>This configures objectTwo with a Factory instance, which it can use to create as many instances
 * of fully-configured MyJSClass objects as it needs, by calling <code>this.myFactory.createInstance()</code>.
 * It can also optionally pass along an object argument to the <code>createInstance</code> method; this
 * object can follow the same structure as a normal object definition (see section "Object Definition
 * Structure" above) and allows you to override individual aspects of the main object definition. For
 * instance:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>this.myFactory.createInstance( { properties: { prop1: 'some other value' } } )</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>This call will return an instance of MyJSClass with properties prop1='some other value' and prop2='some value 2'.</p>
 *
 * <p>A factory object can also be created using the FactoryResolver, for example the above code could be as follows:</p>

 * <pre><code>Wiring.add( {
 *     objectOne: {
 *         type: MyJSClass,
 *         singleton: false,
 *         properties: {
 *             prop1: 'some value 1'
 *             prop2: 'some value 2'
 *         }
 *     },
 *     objectTwo: {
 *         type: MyJSClass2,
 *         properties: {
 *             myFactory: '{factory:objectOne}'
 *         }
 *     }
 * } );</code></pre>
 *
 * <h2>Custom ValueResolvers</h2>
 *
 * <p>As mentioned above, in addition to the built-in "{ref:objectDefId}" placeholder, you can
 * create custom <code>ValueResolver</code>s and register them with arbitrary prefixes. For
 * example, you might want to define a "{cfg:foo}" placeholder which resolves configuration values
 * from some other configuration object. To do this, you would extend <code>Wiring.ValueResolver</code>
 * like so:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>function CfgResolver() {}
 * CfgResolver.prototype = new Wiring.ValueResolver();
 * CfgResolver.prototype.prefix = 'cfg';
 * CfgResolver.prototype.resolve = function( key ) {
 *     return someConfigObject.getConfigValue( key );
 * }
 *
 * Wiring.addValueResolver( new CfgResolver() );</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>Now any "{cfg:foo}" placeholders in object definitions will get their values from the CfgResolver.
 * This is a handy abstraction because the object configurations do not have to implement logic
 * concerning how to retrieve the values, and if the underlying source of the values changes then you
 * only have to modify the ValueResolver implementation and not the configurations themselves.</p>
